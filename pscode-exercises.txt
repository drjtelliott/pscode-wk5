// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


(A) & (B)
BEGIN
INPUT "Enter 5 numbers"
OUTPUT n1,n2,n3,n4,n5
